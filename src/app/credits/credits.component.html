        <p>Lindsey is new to the tech world, but that's not stopping her from embracing all things code. When she's not at her computer, you can catch her creating new concoctions in the kitchen, snuggling with her cats, or leading her Brownie Girl Scout troop to sell more cookies! Lindsey is a lifelong Hoosier, and received her Bachelor's degree from Butler University. She gained notoriety after becoming the official Butler University Mascot dog-sitter who helped coordinate appearances at after hour events on campus. </p>

        <p>Eli is an aspiring developer and data scientist. He has a bachelor's in cognitive science from Indiana University and a master's in logic from the University of Amsterdam. He programs in Python, JavaScript, and Haskell. Eli enjoys animals, music, computers, transit, individuals, information, color, novelty, tropes, meta, and vague lists. Recently for fun (late 2019) he's been solving crosswords and completing his Galar Pok√©dex. He has a St. Bernard mix named Shannon (after Claude Shannon) and an overweight cat named Atsuo Toggle; they say hi. </p>
