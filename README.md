# Vloeistof

The autogenerated README says, "This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19."
So, there's that. If you need the rest of that document it's commented out below.

Vloeistof (Dutch/Flemish for "liquid") is an app to track your mixed drinks. Features include:

* You can search [the CocktailDB](https://thecocktaildb.com/) for drinks that exist there (and then modify them as you wish).
* Alternatively, you can mix your own using our preset list of ingredients or new ingredients that you add yourself. Don't worry, you can always edit!
* Then you can peruse your list of drinks, or see just those you've added from the API or those you've mixed from scratch.
* There's also a favorites feature, for saving your classics that you want easy access to.
* Check out all drinks created by everyone.
* Post comments on those drinks, and see comments from other users.
* The share button opens a prepopulated tweet in a new tab for easy sharing what you're drinking to Twitter.
* We have an admin panel (trust me).
* On mobile you can go to the Chrome menu and "Add to Home Screen" for behavior just like an app.
* You can also "install" the app on desktop (look for the "Install" button in the address bar on Chrome).
* Check out our credits page!
* Our color scheme is tropical and delicious.

Here's a link to the repo for [the back end](https://github.com/dteli/vloeistof-server).
Both back and front ends for this project are [hosted on Heroku](http://vloeistof.herokuapp.com/), so if you're trying out the deployed client please be patient while both spin up.

Made in 2019 for [1150](https://elevenfifty.org/) JavaScript bootcamp by Lindsey, Reese, and Eli.
We learned Angular essentially by ourselves and we're proud of what we accomplished in three weeks.
